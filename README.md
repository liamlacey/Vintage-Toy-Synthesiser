# Vintage Toy Synthesiser #

Vintage Toy Synthesiser is my project for the [Element14 Music Tech Design Challenge](https://www.element14.com/community/community/design-challenges/musictech) where I am converting a wooden vintage toy piano into a standalone digital synthesiser.

## Project Proposal ##

At the time of writing this the project is still under development, however here is the original project proposal specification:
+ Develop a digital synthesis engine that can generate and modify synthesised sounds
+ Modify the existing key mechanism so that it can trigger sounds and control velocity modulation on the synthesis engine
+ Add a set of potentiometers, switches and other controls to the existing piano enclosure for controlling the synthesis engine
+ Add an audio output for connecting the instrument to external speakers and recording equipment
+ Add MIDI I/O so that the instrument can be integrated into existing music production systems
+ Keep the existing aesthetic character of the vintage toy piano
